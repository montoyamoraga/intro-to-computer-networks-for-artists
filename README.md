## About

Introduction to computer networks for artists is a collection of tutorials regarding computer protocols for sharing data between computers and the internet, intended for artists.

It is an open sketchbook, updated frequently and iteratively, riffing off from their original documentation, and everybody is welcome to contribute to it.

It is a project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), started in 2020, during their work as a research assistant at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)'s [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/) and [Future Sketches](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/future-sketches/overview/) research groups, respectively led by [Tod Machover](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tod/overview/) and [Zach Lieberman](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/zachl/overview/).

## Overview

These tutorials are an introduction to:

* These concepts:
  * Bits
