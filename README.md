# introduction-to-computer-networks-for-artists

## About

Introduction to computer networks for artists is a collection of tutorials regarding computer protocols for sharing data between computers and the internet, intended for artists.

This project is an open sketchbook, updated frequently, always in a rough state, and open for contributions.

This project is a celebration of open source software for arts, and an invitation for artists to use networks for collaboration.

This project focuses on sending raw data without compression, and without taking latency into account.

It is a project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), started in 2020, during their work as a research assistant at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)'s [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/) and [Future Sketches](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/future-sketches/overview/) research groups, respectively led by [Tod Machover](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tod/overview/) and [Zach Lieberman](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/zachl/overview/).

## Overview

These tutorials are an introduction to:

* These concepts:
  * Bits
  * IP address
  * Computer server
  * Computer client
* These tasks:
  * Know the IP address of your computer
  * Open a port on your computer to send and receive messages
* These art interactions:
  * Manipulate a synthesizer on your friend's computer
  * Make a drawing on your friend's computer

## Objectives

* Make computers network accesible for beginners
* Celebrate open source software for media arts

## Design constraints

* All software and code runs on Linux,  Mac, Windows desktop computers
* All software and code is free and open source
* All code is documented and commented
* All code examples are less than 100 lines
* All data sent is raw without compression
* All data sent is as fast as possible over internet infrastructure
* Either embrace latency or ignore it
* All communication is unidirectional
* As cheap as possible
* As easy as possible
* As short as possible
* The less jargon the better
* Easy over convoluted

## Assumptions
