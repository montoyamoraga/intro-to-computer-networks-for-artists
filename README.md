# localhost-for-arts

## About

This is a project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/).

## Goals

* Setup connections between computers
* Explain servers and clients
* Explain IP addresses
* Explain bits
* Explain computer protocols and applications for arts

## Constraints

* Open source
* As cheap as possible
* As easy as possible
* All desktop operating system
* Unidirectional communication, like postcards :)
* Not permanent


## Instructions

## Receiver

### Dependencies

We will use the following software on your computer:

* Terminal application
* Node.js
* A web browser

Additionally, you have the option use any combination of these four softwares for media arts:

* [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/)
* [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)

### Setup

* Open your terminal application
* Run the command ```node --version``` to check if you have Node.js installed
  * If your terminal outputs something like ```v14.1.0```, you have Node.js installed, yay.
  * If you don't have Node.js installed, please follow the instructions here: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* Download this repository TODO: add link to releases.
* Uncompress the folder and place it on your Desktop.


### Running




## Dependencies

* Node.js

## Audio

We will use two different programming environments for audio: Pure Data and ChucK.
