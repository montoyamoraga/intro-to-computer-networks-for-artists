# Introduction to computer networks for artists

## About

Introduction to computer networks for artists is a collection of tutorials regarding computer protocols for sharing data between computers and the internet, intended for artists.

This project is an open sketchbook, updated frequently, always in a rough state, and open for contributions.

This project is a celebration of open source software for arts, and an invitation for artists to use networks for collaboration.

This project focuses on sending raw data without compression, and without taking latency into account.
