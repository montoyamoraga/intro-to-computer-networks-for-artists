## Summary

This tutorial introduces you to the use of computer networks for sharing data for drawing.

This tutorial only pre-requisite is tutorial0.md

## Concepts

In this tutorial, two different computers will be used:

### Sender computer

We draw on this computer and send the drawing.

### Receiver computer

We receive the drawing on this computer.

### Canvas

The canvas is a graphics environment on the sender or receiver computer where we draw.

The canvas has a dimension of 256 x 256 pixels.

## Installation

The sender computer must have Processing installed, which is available at [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/).

The receiver computer must have openFrameworks installed, which is available at [https://openframeworks.cc/](https://openframeworks.cc/).

## Setup

Follow this instructions in this order:

* Receiver computer: follows the instructions on tutorial0 for port forwarding.
* Receiver computer: shares its public IP address and target port with the sender computer.
* Receiver computer: runs the openFrameworks code.
* Sender computer: runs the Processing code and draws.




### Parameters


* posX: horizontal position of circle center
* posY: vertical position of circle center
* diameter: size of the circle
* colorR: red amount of fill color
